Let's analyze each line of the given Java code snippet to determine which one is incorrect:

    int[] y = new int[0];
        This line creates an array y of size 0. It is valid to create an array of size 0 in Java, although it may not be very useful in most cases.

    int[] c = new int['a'];
        This line creates an array c of size determined by the ASCII value of 'a'. The ASCII value of 'a' is 97, so this creates an array of size 97.

    int[] s = new int[-31];
        This line attempts to create an array s of negative size. Creating an array with a negative size is not allowed in Java and will result in a negative array size exception.

    int[][][] e = new int[4][5][];
        This line creates a 3D array e with dimensions 4x5, where the third dimension is not specified. It's a valid declaration for a jagged array.

    int r[] = new int[4];
        This line creates an array r of size 4.

Therefore, the incorrect line is:

java

int[] s = new int[-31];

Attempting to create an array with a negative size will result in a runtime exception.
