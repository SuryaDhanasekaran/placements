To find the number of votes won by female candidates whose age is less than 50, you can use the following SQL query:

sql

SELECT SUM(R.votes) AS total_votes
FROM Candidates C
JOIN Results R ON C.id = R.candidate_id
WHERE C.gender = 'F' AND C.age < 50;

This query performs an inner join between the Candidates and Results tables using the candidate ID. It selects the sum of votes (SUM(R.votes)) for female candidates (C.gender = 'F') whose age is less than 50 (C.age < 50).

Applying this query to your example:

sql

SELECT SUM(R.votes) AS total_votes
FROM Candidates C
JOIN Results R ON C.id = R.candidate_id
WHERE C.gender = 'F' AND C.age < 50;

This should return the result:

diff

total_votes
-----------
732974

This output represents the sum of votes won by female candidates whose age is less than 50.
