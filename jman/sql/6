Write a SQL query to display:
The details of the customer whose name starts either with letter C or P>
Your output should contains 6 columns in the below-mentioned order
customer_address_id   customer_id   first_name   address   phone   email

Sure, you can use the SELECT statement with the WHERE clause and the LIKE operator to filter customers whose names start with either 'C' or 'P'. Here's an example SQL query:

sql

SELECT 
    customer_address_id,
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    address,
    phone,
    email
FROM 
    your_customer_table_name
WHERE 
    first_name LIKE 'C%' OR first_name LIKE 'P%';

Replace your_customer_table_name with the actual name of your customer table.

This query selects the specified columns from the customer table where the first_name column starts with either 'C' or 'P'. The % is a wildcard character that matches any sequence of characters.

Make sure to adjust the table name according to your database schema.
