To write a SQL query to display the number of women products available and use the alias product_count, you would need to know the structure of your database. Assuming you have a table named products with a column gender that indicates the gender of the product, you can use a query like the following:

sql

SELECT COUNT(*) AS product_count
FROM products
WHERE gender = 'women';

This query counts the number of rows in the products table where the value in the gender column is 'women'. The result is displayed with the alias product_count. Please replace 'women' with the actual value you use in your database to represent women's products.
