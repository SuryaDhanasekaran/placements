Write an SQL query to display. 
The employee name,employee category and bonus pay(use alias Bonus) for all employees based on the following criteria.

Employee_Category   Bonus
                   A                        6000
                   B                         4000
                   C                         3000
                   D                         2000
If there is no category assigned to an employee then take the bonus as 1000.

Your output should contain 3 columns in the below-mentioned order.
EMP_NAME   EMPLOYEE_CATEGORY   BONUS

Certainly! You can use the CASE statement in SQL to achieve this. Here's an example SQL query:

sql

SELECT
    EMP_NAME,
    EMPLOYEE_CATEGORY,
    CASE
        WHEN EMPLOYEE_CATEGORY = 'A' THEN 6000
        WHEN EMPLOYEE_CATEGORY = 'B' THEN 4000
        WHEN EMPLOYEE_CATEGORY = 'C' THEN 3000
        WHEN EMPLOYEE_CATEGORY = 'D' THEN 2000
        ELSE 1000
    END AS BONUS
FROM
    your_employee_table_name;

Replace your_employee_table_name with the actual name of your employee table.

This query selects the employee name (EMP_NAME), employee category (EMPLOYEE_CATEGORY), and calculates the bonus using a CASE statement based on the given criteria. If there is no category assigned (ELSE condition), it takes the bonus as 1000. Adjust the table name according to your database schema.
