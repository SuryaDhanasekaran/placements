To retrieve all the details of trains that run from or go to a station with a space in its name, you can use the following SQL query. Assuming you have a table named trains with columns such as TRAIN_ID, TRAIN_NAME, TRAIN_TYPE, TRAIN_TIME, TRAIN_FROM, TRAIN_TO, and TRAIN_SPEED, the query would look like this:

sql

SELECT TRAIN_ID, TRAIN_NAME, TRAIN_TYPE, TRAIN_TIME, TRAIN_FROM, TRAIN_TO, TRAIN_SPEED
FROM trains
WHERE TRAIN_FROM LIKE '% %' OR TRAIN_TO LIKE '% %';

This query selects all columns from the trains table where the TRAIN_FROM or TRAIN_TO column contains a space. The % symbol is used as a wildcard to match any sequence of characters.

Adjust the column and table names based on the actual structure of your database.
